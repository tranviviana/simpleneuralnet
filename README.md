Created a number classifier, and language identification, utilizing pytorch to create a simple neural net and a recurring neural net. 
Implemented batching, relu, initial randomness, and network layers to decrease convergence time on test data and hit 88%+ accuracy on test data.
Analyzed different error classifications like cross_entropy, MSE, and euclidean 1 norm,
